            I'm a gamer with a preference for classics like Zelda. Enjoy both
            playing and analyzing video games to understand the world of game
            design.

            I love to spend time developing games, especially RPGs, on the ROBLOX
            platform. Always working on enhancing the user experience and
            storytelling through my games.

        <p>
            With over 2 years of experience, I enjoy creating and rigging
            animations in both ROBLOX and Blender. This hobby helps me add depth
            and realism to my gaming projects and expand my skills in game design.
