            <p>
            I was a back of the house worker. In the morning I would start with
            inventory and placing deliveries. Afterwards I would help with
            prepping the fresh food before we open. On some days I would be
            stationed to greet costumers and help them with their orders. Other
            days I would be on the grill cooking the meat. I also had days where I
            helped with the morning Inventory and placing deliveries.

            <li>Warehouse Agent, 05/2021 - 07/2021 - Corporate Loss Prevention Associates, Jamaica, NY</li>
            <p>
                Mostly had different packages coming in and out of a warehouse 
                located near an airport. The goal was to have all the packages 
                loaded up before the flight leaves. I would sometimes use pallet 
                jacks to move bigger boxes to different places to help around. 
                Also dealt with a lot of mails as well. Near the end of the 
                shift I would also clean up and dispose all the broken pallets, 
                wrappings, boxes that were opened, and sweep a little around the 
                warehouse.
